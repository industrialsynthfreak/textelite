# Pytextelite
Fork of pytextelite code for python 3.

Originally based on [this code](http://automaticromantic.com/static/misc/pytxtelite.txt) which, in turn, uses Ian Bell's Text Elite [C code](http://www.elitehomepage.org/text/index.htm).

Classic Elite galaxy (not Elite+) should be pretty similar to which this code generates (at least system names and their descriptions are correct).

The original text-elite code does not contain any battle or smuggling mechanics, ship upgrades, ratings or missions. I probably will add these parts later.

All cheats removed. Hey, you already have the source codes! Make cheats by yourself.

# Requirements
- python 3 (3.5.0 approved)

# Use
First, run the main app.
```python
python3 app.py
```
Now you may use console commands for info, trading or travelling. You start at Lave like in the original game.

# TODO
- ship upgrades
- smuggling mechanics
- battle mechanics (?)
- `python curses` interface port
